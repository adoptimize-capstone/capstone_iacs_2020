## yolo_training
We're currently looking into using the YOLO model for object detection, training it to detect a cat's eyes, ears, and mouth.

We are using Anton Muehlemann's wrapper around YOLO (with tools to make training as easy as possible), "TrainYourOwnYOLO". Note that we've copied over his code into this repo under the `yolo_training` folder, and adapted it to our own purposes. (Namely the default in Yrain_YOLO.py). For a direct link to Anton's original repository, check out this link: https://github.com/AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO
